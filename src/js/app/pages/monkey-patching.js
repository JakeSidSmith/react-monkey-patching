          A monkey patch is a way for a program to extend or modify supporting system software locally
          (affecting only the running instance of the program).

          So why's it called that?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to
          changing code sneakily – and possibly incompatibly with other such patches – at runtime.

            Replace methods / attributes / functions at runtime, e.g. to stub out a function during testing;

              Modify/extend behaviour of a third-party product without maintaining a private copy of the source code;

          <li>
            Apply a patch at runtime to the objects in memory, instead of the source code on disk;
          </li>
          <li>
            Distribute security or behavioural fixes that live alongside the original source code (an example of
            this would be distributing the fix as a plugin for the Ruby on Rails platform).
